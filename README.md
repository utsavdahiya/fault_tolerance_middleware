# fault_tolerance_middleware
An architecture for fault tolerance middleware that provides fault tolerance as a service for user applications on the top of cloud infrastructure

## Architecture:

## Replication Manager
* __replica group__: a set of VM instances that are controlled by a single implementaion of a replication mechanism(ft_unit).
* Each replica within a group can be uniquely identified.
* A set of rules R(generated by the composition engine, these are also used by the evaluation unit) that must be satisfied by a replica group are specified.
* Task of replication manager is to make the client percieve a replica group as a single service and to ensure that fault free replicas exhibit correct behaviour during execution.

### 1. Replica Invoker
* gets client req from FTM kernel
* formulates the structure of a replica group with the desired replication stratergy.
* gets information about the required resources from Resource Manager(RM).

> Has to also consider the relative placement of the replicas. Such as ensuring that primary and backup are not on the same host.

### 2. Sequencer
* Provides input to the application running in a reolica group by means of a __consensus protocol__ to ensure determinism
* It basically manages how the incoming messages are received by a replica group.

### 3. Synchronizer
* Techniques to perform backup (active/passive).
* Leader election
* membership changes: keeping updated view of the group even in cases where some nodes may fail.
* Checkpointing

### 4. Output Analyzer
* Carries out majority voting(or some other technique) on the results obtained from the many replicas within a replica group and presents the results back to the client.

### 5. Replica Group Manager
